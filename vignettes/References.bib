@article{METHODS,
	Abstract = {Family-based designs are regaining popularity for genomic sequencing studies because they provide a way to test cosegregation with disease of variants that are too rare in the population to be tested individually in a conventional case-control study. Where only a few affected subjects per family are sequenced, the probability that any variant would be shared by all affected relatives-given it occurred in any one family member-provides evidence against the null hypothesis of a complete absence of linkage and association. A P-value can be obtained as the sum of the probabilities of sharing events as (or more) extreme in one or more families. We generalize an existing closed-form expression for exact sharing probabilities to more than two relatives per family. When pedigree founders are related, we show that an approximation of sharing probabilities based on empirical estimates of kinship among founders obtained from genome-wide marker data is accurate for low levels of kinship. We also propose a more generally applicable approach based on Monte Carlo simulations. We applied this method to a study of 55 multiplex families with apparent non-syndromic forms of oral clefts from four distinct populations, with whole exome sequences available for two or three affected members per family. The rare single nucleotide variant rs149253049 in ADAMTS9 shared by affected relatives in three Indian families achieved significance after correcting for multiple comparisons ([Formula: see text]).

@article{COPY_NUMBER,
	Abstract = {By sequencing the exomes of distantly related individuals in multiplex families, rare mutational and structural changes to coding DNA can be characterized and their relationship to disease risk can be assessed. Recently, several rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were associated with an increased risk of nonsyndromic oral cleft, highlighting the importance of rare sequence variants in oral clefts and illustrating the strength of family-based study designs. However, the extent to which rare deletions in coding regions of the genome occur and contribute to risk of nonsyndromic clefts is not well understood. To identify putative structural variants underlying risk, we developed a pipeline for rare hemizygous deletions in families from whole exome sequencing and statistical inference based on rare variant sharing. Among 56 multiplex families with 115 individuals, we identified 53 regions with one or more rare hemizygous deletions. We found 45 of the 53 regions contained rare deletions occurring in only one family member. Members of the same family shared a rare deletion in only eight regions. We also devised a scalable global test for enrichment of shared rare deletions.},
