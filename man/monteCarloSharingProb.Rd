\title{calculates sharing probability by simulating pedigree outcomes}
\usage{
monteCarloSharingProb(procPed, alleleFreq, kinshipCoeff, nSim, founderDist)
}
\arguments{
\item{procPed}{pedigree that has been through \code{processPedigree}}

\item{alleleFreq}{allele frequency among the founders}

\item{kinshipCoeff}{mean kinship coefficient among the founders}

\item{nSim}{number of simulations used in monte carlo calculation}

\item{founderDist}{#TODO}
}
\value{
sharing probability
}
\description{
Calculates the same exact probability as RVsharing,
 except uses monte carlo simulation instead of exact computation.
 This method allows for more flexibility in the scenarios considered.
