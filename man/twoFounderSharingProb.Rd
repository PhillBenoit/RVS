\title{sharing probability when founder pair introduces variant}
\usage{
twoFounderSharingProb(procPed, kinshipCoeff, kinshipOrder)
}
\arguments{
\item{procPed}{pedigree that has been through processPedigree()}

\item{kinshipCoeff}{mean kinship coefficient among the founders}

\item{kinshipOrder}{order of the polynomial approximation to the distribtion
of the number of distinct alleles in the founders (d in Bureau et al.).
Must be <= 5}
}
\value{
sharing probability
}
\description{
In the case of relatedness among founders, assume that up
to two founders could introduce the variant and condition on all possible
pairs.
